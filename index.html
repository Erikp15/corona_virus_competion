            <br>
            <br> Hello world,
            <br> I am Erik Paskalev and my whole school district is on flu vacation - the regular kind (for now :-).
            <br> So I am learning important things like AI/statistics and medicine/viruses. 
            <br> While the adults are doing the important work of controling and minimizing the spread of the "corona"-virus (2019-nCoV),
            <br>
            <b>
            <br> I am organizing an informal AI contest with my friends - who will most accurately predict the number of cases and deaths from 2019-nCoV.
            </b>
            <br>
            <br> Simple rules for our informal AI contest:
            <br> 1. Submit daily predictions to this google form (deadline is midnight Boson/EST time i.e. 5am GMT)
                  link here:

            <br> 2. If you make multiple predictions, I will take your last prediction. Submit more than 5 predictions and I will ignore your prediction for that day.
            <br> 3. John Hopkins University generates multiple reports per day. I will use their first one for each day.
            <br> 4. Winners are sorted by absolute distance (i.e. over-predicting and under-predicting are weighted equally).
            <br>
            <br>Daily winners will be published at this page:
            <a href=results.html>All historical results</a>
        </p>
